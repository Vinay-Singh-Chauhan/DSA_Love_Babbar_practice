Stability is mainly essential when we have key-value pairs with duplicate keys possible (like peopleâ€™s names as keys and their details as values). And we wish to sort these objects by keys.

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input data set
